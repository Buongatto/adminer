<h1>Adminer (edited)</h1>
This is a version of one of the best lightweight phpMyadmin alternatives. <br>
Using this light (205 kB) single PHP file you can simply manage databases <br>and database users as an administrator, as well as maintain databases for different projects. <br>
In most cases, it allows you to replace phpMyAdmin. <br>
You can easily integrate it into your projects. <br>
<em><strong>Warning!</strong></em> <strong>This version only contains the MySQL driver!</strong>

<h2>Features</h2>
 - MySQL version: 8.4.0; <br>
 - It supports PHP Version 8.3.7; <br>
 - Dark theme is built-in by default; <br>
 - The script tested on Apache/2.4.59 (Win64) OpenSSL/1.1.1n PHP/8.3.7; <br>
 - Base64 encoding allowed to make the final version even lighter; <br>
 - It's easier to make/change skins (look at the line 159: you need to decode and decompress CSS template, than make your changes and replace the main template); <br>
 - Minor bugs were fixed and images were replaced with html entities.
